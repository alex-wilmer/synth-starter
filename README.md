# About

In this live interactive tutorial, we will explore the basics of audio synthesis through the very convenient, very easy to use Web Audio API. You will be given a pre-builtuser interface with all of the fixins of a typical synthesizer--knobs, toggles, sliders, oh my!--and it will be your job to write the code that generates the sound and hooks into the UI to shape your synth's output into something beautiful (or chaotic, if that's your thing).

Come and learn just how easy it is to make sweet, sweet music right from your browser!
